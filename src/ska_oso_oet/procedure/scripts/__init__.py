The procedure.scripts package contains scripts that need to be bundled with
the OET.

TODO: With the introduction of git scripts and inclusion of ska-oso-scripting
in the OET image, it should be possible to replace this package with a
reference to an abort observing script contained and maintained in
ska-oso-scripting.
