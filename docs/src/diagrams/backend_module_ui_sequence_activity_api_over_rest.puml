cli -> FlaskWorker: HTTP POST to /api/v1/activities
note right
The User executes an OET CLI command at
the terminal. The OET CLI uses HTTP POST
to send a JSON object encapsulating the
request (activity name, scheduling block ID,
etc.) to the REST backend.
end note

FlaskWorker -> ActivityWorker: send message request.activity.run
note right
""FlaskWorker"" creates a ""ActivityCommand""
encapsulating the request details and announces
the event on the //Run Activity requested// request
topic. It will then wait for a response on the //Activity//
//running// response topic.
end note

ActivityWorker -> ActivityService: prepare_run_activity(cmd: ActivityCommand, request_id: int)
note right
Pass the request_id to ActivityService where it
keeps a record of request IDs mapped to activity
IDs. This is so that the service can use the
request ID in messages sent to the procedure
domain and any events published from procedure
domain are linked to the correct activity.
end note

ActivityService -> ODA: oda.sbds.get(sbd_id)
note right
Retrieve the Scheduling Block Definition from ODA.
The ODA client will return a SBDefinition PDM object.
end note
ODA -> ActivityService: pdm.SBDefinition

opt script_args provided
ActivityService -> ActivityService: update SB args
end
note right
If user has provided additional arguments for the script,
the retrieved SB is updated to include any additional
arguments and overwrite any existing keyword arguments
end note

ActivityService -> ActivityService: write SB to file
note right
ActivityService will write SB JSON to file with a unique
name consisting of SB ID, SB version and timestamp. SBs
are stored in folder /tmp/sbs/ and path to the SB is passed
as an argument in the PrepareProcessCommand
end note

ActivityService -> ActivityService: add SB path to kwargs
note right
The SB JSON filepath string is appended to the list of
script keyword arguments for //main// function under
the key //sb_json//.
end note


ActivityService -> ScriptExecutionServiceWorker: message request.procedure.prepare

note right
ActivityService creates a PrepareProcessCommand and
announces it on the Create Procedure topic. It then
waits for the response topic Procedure Created and
creates an ActivitySummary based on  the response that
is passed on to the REST backend and client.
end note

ScriptExecutionServiceWorker -> ScriptExecutionService: prepare(cmd: PrepareProcessCommand)

ScriptExecutionService -> ScriptExecutionServiceWorker: ProcedureSummary

ScriptExecutionServiceWorker -> ActivityWorker: message procedure.lifecycle.created

ActivityWorker -> ActivityService: complete_run_activity(result: ProcedureSummary, request_id: int)

note right
ActivityService inspects each procedure.lifecycle.created
message and checks if the request ID maps to any activity.
This check is done to make sure that the message has
originated from a procedure created by the activity domain
rather than independently by the procedure domain.
If the request ID does not map to an activity, ActivityService
will return a null response to ActivityWorker which will know
to keep waiting for another procedure.lifecycle.created message.
end note

opt prepare_only not set
ActivityService -> ScriptExecutionServiceWorker: message request.procedure.start (force=true)
note right
By default the ScriptExecutionServiceWorker
does not allow a StartProcessCommand to be
queued if the process is not yet ready to start.
Instead of the ActivityService waiting for the
process to be ready, set a flag to tell the
SESWorker to ignore the current process state
and queue the start command anyway.
end note


end
note right
**Note**
If **prepare_only** flag is not set, the
ActivityService creates and announces
a StartProcessCommand but currently
does not wait for response to further
follow the lifecycle of the created
procedure
end note

ActivityService -> ActivityWorker: ActivitySummary

ActivityWorker -> FlaskWorker: message activity.lifecycle.running

cli <- FlaskWorker: HTTP OK + ActivitySummary JSON
note right
The FlaskWorker will block the client side until it
receives a message on activity.lifecycle.running
topic from the ActivityWorker indicating that the
preparation on the activity has been started.
Afterwards the user can stay updated on the activity
status by querying the procedure CLI with the script
ID given by the ActivitySummary or by listening to
the lifecycle events.
